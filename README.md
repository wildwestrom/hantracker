  Tracks your progress learning Chinese Characters.

After you launch the program here's how it works:
1. Put in a list of Chinese characters you wish to learn.
2. You'll see each character and have to say if you know the meaning or not, one by one.
3. The program then shows you your progress by how many you know.

Note: 
You must set the proper font for the language you wish to study on your OS. (I tried, but doing this for you was too much work).

## Roadmap

Here are some features I'd like to add.

- [x] Preset lists of characters for testing
- [x] A back button to re-answer a previous question on the test
  - [x] A view of the previously answered character to confirm you actually knew the character
- [ ] A way to save and re-load your progress
- [ ] Render a wallpaper of your learning progress
